# submitonlyhighshares
submite high shares only skip low shares written in python all you need todo is download it extract file, run python3 -m pip install -r requirements then run python3 highshare.py
input your pool address like stratum://k1pool.com port is ur miners port to pool
input ur miner address with worker name thats it and hit run
This is working with latest miner software like gminer , lolminer,nbminer & trex miner
the url and port from the largehash will need to be input into ur gminer in address and port and then the shares will be forwarded to ur pool,
the ping is very low when i tested it it was 12ms 14ms on 2miners depending on what country your from.
